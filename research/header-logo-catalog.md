# Pokemon Ruby GBA header logo release catalog

The existing Japanese extraction is retained as the origin artifact. Every one of the 13 cataloged releases (Japanese, English, German, French, Italian, Spanish) has the same 156-byte Nintendo logo payload at GBA header offset `0x04`. BIOS Huffman and cumulative decoding reproduces the existing 104x16 logical image and its 4x nearest-neighbor PNG byte-for-byte.

Per-release reports link exact ROM identities to the shared payload and rendered asset. No duplicate PNG and no raw ROM bytes are published.
